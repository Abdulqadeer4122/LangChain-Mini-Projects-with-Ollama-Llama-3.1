# LangChain Mini Projects with Ollama Llama 3.1

This repository contains three mini-projects built using LangChain and powered by Ollama's Llama 3.1. Each project demonstrates the versatility and capabilities of language models in various applications. The projects included are:

1. **News Summarizer**  
   A tool that summarizes news articles using the NewsAPI. Just input your preferred news topic, and it will fetch the latest articles and provide concise summaries.

2. **Pet Name Generator**  
   A fun project that suggests cool names for your pet based on their current name and color. Simply input the pet's name and color, and it will generate five unique and creative name suggestions.
